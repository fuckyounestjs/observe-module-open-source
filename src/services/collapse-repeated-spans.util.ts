/**
 * Tag under which a collapsed node records how many calls it stands for.
 *
 * A tag rather than a field of its own so the wire format does not change:
 * `tags` is already on every span and already declared by the collector's
 * contract, so an agent emitting this needs no matching collector release. A
 * collector that does not know the tag stores it like any other and
 * attributes the node as one call; one that does reads the true count here.
 * Namespaced so it reads as the agent's in a span's tag list, and safe from
 * collision: the node it sits on never exists at runtime, so no user code can
 * set tags on it, and the tags of the calls it replaces are dropped.
 *
 * Absent on an ordinary span, which stands for exactly one call. On a node
 * that carries it, `duration` is the *sum* of the replaced calls' durations,
 * `startOffset` and `spanId` are the earliest call's, and `children` holds
 * every child the replaced calls had - which is what keeps the parent's self
 * time and the subtree's class attribution exactly what they were. Ordering
 * among the replaced calls is lost. The node is one event on the wire and is
 * metered as one.

 * Collapses repeated siblings throughout a completed span tree, in place.
 *
 * Within one list of siblings, auto spans are grouped by `className` and

 * longest-running members and every member that errored as ordinary spans;
 * the rest are replaced by one node that records how many calls it stands
 * for (`SPAN_COLLAPSED_TAG`) and the sum of their durations. Manual spans are never collapsed - a
 * user named each of them deliberately - and ongoing nodes, which a shipped
 * tree should not contain, are left alone.
 *
 * Summing the durations, rather than taking the wall-clock envelope, is what
 * keeps the collector's self-time partition exact: a parent's self time is its
 * duration minus the durations of its children, and the sum over the surviving
 * children is the same as it was over the originals. The collapsed calls'
 * own children are carried across onto the collapsed node for the same reason
 * one level down, and then collapsed among themselves in turn - a repeated
 * frame that always calls the same repeated frame collapses at both levels.
 *
 * Siblings are matched wherever they sit in the list, not only when adjacent:
 * a pipe run once per argument interleaves with the resolver calls it
 * validates for. The collapsed node takes the position of the earliest call
 * it replaces, so ordering relative to the *other* siblings is kept; ordering
 * among the collapsed calls themselves is lost.
 *
 * Returns the new sibling list for the level passed in. Descendant lists are
 * rewritten through their parents' `children`.
