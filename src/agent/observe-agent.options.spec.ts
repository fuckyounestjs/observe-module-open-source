/**
 * Covers option resolution, not the agent.
 *
 * `runtimeMetrics` gauges how loaded a process is; `profiling` samples stacks
 * to say which code it was running. They are different signals with different
 * costs, and the cases below are mostly about keeping them independent - the
 * cheap one must not switch on the one that samples the hot path.
 *
 * `profiling` is currently shelved - commented out of `ObserveOptions`, and
 * `startContinuousProfiling()` is no longer called - so the cases that mention
 * it assert that it stays off. The implementation is kept and tested
 * elsewhere; these guard the wiring for the day it comes back.
 *
 * `runtimeMetrics` was once called `profiler`, one letter from `profiling` for
 * an unrelated signal. The alias has since been removed outright.
